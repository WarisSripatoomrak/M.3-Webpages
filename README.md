# M.3-Webpages
https://warissripatoomrak.github.io/M.3-Webpages/
This is my first guided attempt of creating a webpage back in 2020. I didn't even know what HTML was, I could understood some of the codes and still can't understand all of them even now in M.5, we don't really get exposed to real codes in my school. I had a great time making this webpage: designing the banner, working with aesthetics, everything.

Come to think of it, coding a website in M.3 was more advanced in M.5 as we use Adobe Dreamweaver, but actually create a real website with a ton of webpages. We have to learn Python in semester 2, this time's real coding.
